	The repeat-x line tripped me up for a bit because I had forgotten I had set the background-color
	to white at the end of body's styling and was confused why it wouldnt stay #00569f when I set it
	to that at the start. Because the y-axis repeating of the gradient also made the bottom white,
	I misunderstood my issue! I set the max width to a size that would ensure the text in the <p>
	block doesn't end up as a single orphaned line. It still trails a bit, but it's not too bad.

	The px amounts throughout are the result of trial-and-error. I'm a tad neurotic about presentation,
	so I did my best to match the included images by pasting them into a collage (thanks Paint3D!) and
	using the zoom tool in Windows Photos to try to match the titlebar size so I could set the height
	accurately.
	I used skyblue for the nav color because I figured the color used in the original would be one
	of the standardized colors, and it looks quite close. I'm not sure if it's exactly the same,
	but I don't feel it's necessary to use a color picker to extract the exact RGB values.
